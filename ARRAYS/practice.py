Arrays and shit

Goal of this
    - have the user input what their fav number is from 0 - 100
    - have the user input what their least fav number is from 0 - 100
    - build two random arrays filled with random numbers
    - search through both arrays using linear search looking for their
    fav number in first array and least fav in second array
    - time both searches and see which is quicker

Write some TDD tests for it for extra practice
