Goal: Have the user enter a number
From that number, build a loop to determine how many multiples of 7 are less than that number
Then transform that loop in a recursive function that does the same thing

Have the user enter their favorite fruit
Build a loop to reverse the string
Then transform that loop into a recursive function

Write some TDD tests for it for extra practice
